How to Use This Project
Setup Database:

Create a MySQL database using the provided SQL script

Update the database credentials in includes/config.php

Installation:

Place all files in your web server's root directory (e.g., htdocs/student-portal)

Make sure your web server (Apache, Nginx) is running with PHP support

Access the Portal:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/student-portal

Register as a student and log in

Take available exams and view your results

Admin Setup (Optional):

To create exams and questions, you would need to create an admin interface (not included in this basic version)

Security Considerations
Always use HTTPS in production

Consider adding CSRF protection for forms

Implement rate limiting for login attempts

Regularly update your PHP version and dependencies

Consider using prepared statements instead of direct SQL queries for better security
